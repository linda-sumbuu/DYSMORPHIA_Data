  - This sign...maybe it can lead me to an exit? What does it say?
  - '"Welcome to my world, dear traveller. This forest is my hide out."'
  - '"You see, dear traveller...I have lost myself in these woods. Quite literally."'
  - '"My arms, legs and face! Guarded by these horrifying beasts."'
  - '"They took claim of MY body parts, dear traveller. The journey of a lady''s
    suffering never ceases."'
  - '"If you have read this far...it must mean that you too have lost yourself."'
  - '"Perhaps then we can help each other."'
  - '"Find my body parts, oh dear traveller. For only I know the exit to this nightmare."'
  - '"You will find me just by the lake in the depths of these woods."'
  - '"I have placed signs throughout these cursed woods for you to follow."'
  - '"My journey too was a long and cursed one. You will learn more through my signs."'
  - '"Good luck, dear traveller. I only hope you stay safe from harm..."'
  - Either this is a practical joke or a dream. Body parts stolen and she's not dead?
  - I'm...scared. But I'm even more scared to stay here...
  - I hope she really did scatter those signs around because I'm completely defenceless...
  - Let's just pray I make it out of here with all my body parts.
