  - '"..."'
  - H-hello...forest spirit?
  - '"Are you a wish-seeker?"'
  - W-what? Oh n-no! I was just...
  - '"You are looking for someone."'
  - Y-yes. Do you know who she is?
  - '"She asked me for a wish, I know only of her deepest want to rid herself of
    her arms."'
  - She asked you to get rid of her arms? Why?
  - '"I cannot reveal that."'
  - The other spirit said the same thing. Is there a confidentiality agreement or
    something?
  - '"No. It is simply because you are aware of why. I do not see the need to repeat
    it."'
  - Wh-what! I know nothing about this woman? She just told me to stay away from
    you.
  - She said you were dangerous. She said she could help me get out and fight you
    using this mirr-
  - '"You are an interesting human."'
  - What...?
  - '"You claim to know nothing. But I can see. You can lie to the other spirit,
    but not to me."'
  - '"I see it all. And I see the desperation rotting your brain. You know nothing
    of this woman...yet you come to find her limbs?"'
  - '"If you were truly looking for an exit...you would have wished for it by now."'
  - '"But you yearn for something darker."'
  - You-you don't know me. I'm just trying to go home.
  - The woman...she said you could not be trusted. That you would kill me too...
  - '"I am a protector of this forest. I feel no thirst for blood."'
  - '"I will not hold you back any longer. You say that you do not know who to believe..."'
  - '"But you have already made your choice."'
