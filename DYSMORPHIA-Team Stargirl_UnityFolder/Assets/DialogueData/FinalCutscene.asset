  dialogue:
  - '"You''re finally here! I started to think you may have died."'
  - Wh-what...what...are you?
  - '"What do you mean? Did you not read any of my signs?"'
  - No! I mean why do you look so much like me?!
  - '"..."'
  - This...this is a nightmare.
  - '"No. It is very much real. And you did nothing that I told you to do."'
  - '"This was expected."'
  - Answer me! Why do you look like me?! What are you? Why am I here?
  - '"You''re very aware why."'
  - The forest spirit said the same. What do you want from me?!
  - '"I want you to surrender."'
  - What...?
  - '"I tried to fix things. I tried to help you."'
  - '"But you don''t want my help. You just can''t help but ruin it for yourself."'
  - '"You pushed me away."'
  - You're not making sense!
  - '"Why did you not bring back my limbs? Did you even ask?"'
  - The mons- the forest spirits refused to help me...
  - '"You''re lying."'
  - What?!
  - '"If you had just listened to me...you would be home by now."'
  - '"I wanted you to bring them back yourself and you refused! Now we will never
    know."'
  - Know...know what?
  - '"Did you ever use the mirror?"'
  - The...mirror?
  - '"Yes, the mirror I left you. I want my face back. Don''t you?"'
  - I have a face!
  - '"No. That is not your face. Use the mirror and see for yourself."'
  - 'I don''t trust you. The spirits told me you''re a liar. '
  - '"You don''t know what I see."'
  - Stop.
  - '"You don''t even know your own name. You say you don''t know who I am...but
    you do. "'
  - '"You don''t even know if your own body is your own, or someone else''s."'
  - '"You just don''t want to admit it."'
  - '"What you perceive as real, may not even be real. You''re unsure aren''t you?
    That''s why you never used the mirror."'
  - Please...stop.
  - '"You couldn''t even recognise your own arms and legs. You''re too scared to
    see what they looked like. You didn''t ask the spirits because you were scared."'
  - '"The reality is, you don''t recognise me and you didn''t find my face because
    you''re afraid."'
  - No...I was helping...
  - '"Yourself. You don''t want to accept that you are lost. You don''t want to accept
    that the monster YOU wrote about...was you all along."'
  - ...
  - '"I hid our limbs so that you could find yourself again. So you could see how
    twisted this place has become because of you."'
  - '"I had only ever wished for you to accept yourself."'
  - I can't.
  - It's not me. I couldn't let anyone see me like that!
  - I...don't want to be found...not like this. Not while looking like a monster.
  - '"..."'
  - '"Tell me...what do you see in the mirror?"'
  - The...mirror?
  - '"What do you see?"'
