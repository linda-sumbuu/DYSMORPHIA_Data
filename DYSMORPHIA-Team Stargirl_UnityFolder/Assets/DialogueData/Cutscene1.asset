  dialogue:
  - The mind is a powerful enitity, capable of far more power we presume it holds.
  - The more we become exposed to others, the more we start seeing the faults within
    ourselves.
  - Some may call this fickle; shallow even.
  - But your mind is not escapable.
  - The sheer obsession with perfection and flawlessness can often lead our minds
    to distort reality.
  - What do you see when you look in the mirror? Is it truly you?
  - Or is it the demons you fight against...daily?
  - Lost in a world where the only thing to do is move forward, you are unaware of
    what lays ahead.
  - Where are you? And most importantly...WHO are you?
