  dialogue:
  - '"Dear traveller, have you ever read the story of Cinderella?"'
  - '"I find myself very akin to her. She lost one of her shoes trying to go home
    before the clock struck midnight."'
  - '"I lost my legs around here. I am devastated. I used to think them as troublesome.
    They never looked right in my dresses."'
  - '"When I got lost, my feet started to hurt. I thought once more about how troublesome
    they were to me."'
  - '"I thought for a long time that if I could, I''d change them to my liking. They
    were so vile to look at and so useless to me in that moment..."'
  - '"I wished for them to disappear forever!"'
  - '"Oh how wrong I was to do so. A monster overheard and stole them from me."'
  - '"I didn''t mean it, dear traveller. I want them back."'
  - '"They were just so useless in that moment! They couldn''t even carry me anywhere."'
  - '"But now...with them gone...I should feel happier since I hated them so much...but..."'
  - '"There are so many ways I could improve on them now! If only you''d help me
    find them..."'
  - I really wonder how she escaped the monster with no legs.
  - ...I hope I don't end up crossing that monster.
  - What is that over there? So much light...
