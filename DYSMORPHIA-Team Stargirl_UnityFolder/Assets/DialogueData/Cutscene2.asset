  dialogue:
  - '"Who goes there?"'
  - I-I come in peace...
  - '"Why do you look so afraid? I will not harm you."'
  - Wait, really? So you're not a...m-monster?
  - '"Monster? No monster roams this area. I am simply a forest spirit."'
  - Wait...what? No monsters roam around here? I was told monsters that steal limbs-
  - '"What?! So she sent you here, didn''t she?"'
  - Well, I don't exactly know her name yet but...
  - '"That woman...is lying to you. She is not to be trusted."'
  - '"No monsters roam these lands and she did not get her limbs ''stolen''. She
    left them with me for a wish."'
  - A wish? What was the wish?
  - '"I cannot divulge that, but she was incredibly desperate. I should have never
    indulged her."'
  - Why...would she lie to me, then?
  - '"That is not something I can answer. You will have to ask her yourself. Unless
    you too have something to offer me..."'
  - '"I will now ask you to leave, if you please. I feel disgraced by that woman''s
    lies."'
  - Oh! Uh...sure. Thank you for your help.
