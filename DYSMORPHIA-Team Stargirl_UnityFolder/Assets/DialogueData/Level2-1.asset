  - ...gone.
  - That spirit had some nerve, calling me a liar.
  - The real liar is that woman. Twice now that I get told that she willingly left
    her body parts behind.
  - From the way that spirit was talking and the density of these woods...she shouldn't
    be far now.
  - I need to find the exit and fast. I've had enough of this treasure hunt.
  - ' I wonder if I should throw this mirror away now. It has proven itself to be
    completely useless.'
